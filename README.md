## About

Kia Ora,

This is a ticketing app that I have made for smaller venues during the Covid-19 pandemic to help with contact tracing, getting people through the doors quicker and for after the pandemic, not to have to pay fees to the big corparations. 

This part of the app is mainly for registering, there is no admin panel (yet) and is intended to be used along side phpmyadmin. Currently making a new event requires adding the table manually and editing the code to match with that table. For scanning there is an Android app currently in development available [here](https://github.com/domkab16/Rona-Ticket-Scanner), It is still under development but should be finished soon.
